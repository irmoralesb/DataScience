Qualitative and Quantitative Bivariate Analysis
===============================================

*Visualizing both a categorical and a numeric variable*

For this type of analysis we group numeric variable using categorical variable, usually we use an aggregate value.

Usually we:

    1) Look for a aggregate value
    2) Gruop by category
    3) Use the result to compare them

### Bar Chart

For instance comparing the rating aganist its Box Office revenue.

With this chart we only see comparisson by one aggregate value for one category, to compare more aggregate values at once we have to see additional data visualization.

### Bivariate Box Plot

X-axis we use categorical variable, and y-axis numeric variable.

it is used to:

    * Location
    * Spread
    * Outliers

### Notched Box Plot

The main difference with the previous is that the box is notches around the median value of each box plot, that is the confidence values.

    * Notches
    * Confidence interval

### Bivariate Violin Plot

We can check

    * Density
    * Shape
