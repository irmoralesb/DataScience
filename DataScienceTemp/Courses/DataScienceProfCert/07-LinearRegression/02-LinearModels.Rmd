This section has four parts: Introduction to Linear Models, Least Squares Estimates, Tibbles, do, and broom, and Regression and Baseball. 

## Introduction to Linear Models

###Confunding: are BBs more preditive?


In a previous video, we found that the slope
of the regression line for predicting runs from bases on balls was 0.735.
So, does this mean that if we go and higher low salary
players with many bases on balls that increases the number of walks per game
by 2 for our team?
Our team will score 1.47 more runs per game?
**We are again reminded that association is not causation.**
The data does provide strong evidence that a team with 2 more bases on balls
per game than *the average team scores 1.47 more runs per game*,
but this does not mean that bases on balls are the cause.
**If we do compute the regression line slope for singles, we get 0.449, a lower value.**
Note that a single gets you to first base just like a base on ball.
Those that know a little bit more about baseball
will tell you that with a single, runners that are on base
have a better chance of scoring than with a base on balls.
So, how can base on balls be more predictive of runs?
The reason this happens is because of confounding.
**Note the correlation between homeruns, bases on balls, and singles.**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
ds_theme_set()
data(LahmanData)
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(Singles = (H-HR-X2B-X3B)/G, BB=BB/G, HR = HR/G) %>%
  summarize(cor(BB,HR), cor(Singles,HR),cor(BB,Singles))
```

We see that the correlation between bases on balls and homeruns
is quite high compared to the other two pairs.
It turns out that pitchers, afraid of homeruns,
will sometimes avoid throwing strikes to homerun hitters.
As a result, homerun hitters tend to have more bases on balls.
Thus, a team with many homeruns will also
have more bases on balls than average, and as a result,
**it may appear that bases on balls cause runs. But it is actually the homeruns that caused the runs. In this case, we say that bases on balls are confounded with homeruns.**
But could it be that bases on balls still help?
To find out, we somehow have to adjust for the homerun effect.
Regression can help with this.

### Stratification and Multivariate Regression

To try to determine if bases on balls is still useful for creating runs,
a **first approach is to keep home runs fixed at a certain value and then examine the relationship between runs and bases on balls.**
As we did when we stratified fathers by rounding to the closest inch,
here, **we can stratify home runs per game to the closest 10th.**
We filtered our strata with few points.
We use this code to generate an informative data set.

```{r}
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR_strata = round(HR/G,1),
         BB_per_game = BB/G,
         R_per_game = R/G) %>%
  filter(HR_strata >= 0.4 & HR_strata <= 1.2)
```


And then, we can make a scatter plot for each strata.
A scatterplot of runs versus bases on balls.
This is what it looks like.
```{r}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(BB_per_game, R_per_game)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~HR_strata)

```


**Remember that the regression slope for predicting runs with bases on balls when we ignore home runs was 0.735.**
But once we stratify by home runs, these slopes are substantially reduced.
We can actually see what the slopes are by using this code.
We stratify by home run and then compute the slope using the formula
that we showed you previously.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR_strata) %>%
  summarize(slope= cor(BB_per_game, R_per_game)*sd(R_per_game)/sd(BB_per_game))
```


These values are closer to the slope we obtained from singles, which is 0.449.
Which is more consistent with our intuition.
Since both singles and bases on ball get us to first base,
they should have about the same predictive power.
Now, although our understanding of the application-- our understanding
of baseball-- tells us that home runs cause bases on balls and not
the other way around, we can still check if, after stratifying by base on balls,
we still see a home run effect or if it goes down.
We use the same code that we just used for bases on balls.
But now, we swap home runs for bases on balls to get this plot.

```{r}
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(BB_strata = round(BB/G,1),
         HR_per_game = HR/G,
         R_per_game = R/G) %>%
  filter(BB_strata >= 2.8 & BB_strata <= 3.9)

dat %>% ggplot(aes(HR_per_game,R_per_game)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~BB_strata)
  
```


In this case, the slopes are the following.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(BB_strata) %>%
  summarize(slope = cor(HR_per_game,R_per_game)*sd(R_per_game)/sd(HR_per_game))
```


You can see they are all around 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.
So they do not change that much from the original slope
estimate, which was 1.84.
Regardless, it seems that if we stratify by home runs,
we have an approximately bivariate normal distribution
for runs versus bases on balls.
Similarly, if we stratify by bases on balls,
we have an approximately normal bivariate distribution
for runs versus home runs.
So what do we do?
It is somewhat complex to be computing regression lines for each strata.
We're essentially fitting this model that you
can see in this equation with the slopes for x1 changing for different values
of x2 and vice versa.

![Formula edited](figs/formula_edited.png)

Here, x1 is bases on balls.
And x2 are home runs.
Is there an easier approach?
**Note that if we take random variability into account, the estimated slopes by strata don't appear to change that much.**
If these slopes are in fact the same, this
implies that this function beta 1 of x2 and the other function beta 2 of x1
are actually constant.

![Constants](figs/constants.png)

Which, in turn, implies that the expectation
of runs condition on home runs and bases on balls
can be written in this simpler model.

![Simplified model](figs/simplified_model.png)


This model implies that if the number of home runs is fixed,
**we observe a linear relationship between runs and bases on balls.**
And that the slope of that relationship does not
depend on the number of home runs.
**Only the slope changes as the home runs increase.**
The same is true if we swap home runs and bases on balls.
In this analysis, **referred to as multivariate regression, we say that the bases on balls slope beta 1 is adjusted for the home run effect. If this model is correct, then confounding has been accounted for.**
But how do we estimate beta 1 and beta 2 from the data?
For this, we'll learn about linear models and least squares estimates.

### Linear Models

Since Galton's original development, regression
has become one of the most widely used tools in data science.
One reason for this has to do with the fact
that **regression permits us to find relationships between two variables while adjusting for others**, as we have just shown for bases on balls and home
runs.
**This has been particularly popular in fields where randomized experiments are hard to run,**
such as economics and epidemiology.
** When we're not able to randomly assign each individual to a treatment or control group, confounding is particularly prevalent.**
For example, consider estimating the effect of any fast foods
on life expectancy using data collected from a random sample of people
in some jurisdiction.
Fast food consumers are more likely to be smokers,
drinkers, and have lower incomes.
Therefore, a naive regression model may lead
to an overestimate of a negative health effect of fast foods.
So how do we adjust for confounding in practice?
We can use regression.
** We have described how, if data is by very normal, then the conditional expectation follow a regression line, that the conditional expectation as a line is not an extra assumption, but rather a result derived from the assumption, that they are approximately by very normal.**  
However, **in practice it is common to explicitly write down a model that describes the relationship between two or more variables using what is called a linear model.**
We know that linear here does not refer to lines exclusively,
but rather to the fact that the conditional expectation is
a linear combination of known quantities.
Any combination that multiplies them by a constant and then
adds them up with, perhaps, a shift.

![Linear model formula](figs/linear_model_formula.png)

For example, 2 plus 3x minus 4y plus 5z is a linear combination of x, y, and z.
So beta 0 plus beta 1x1, plus beta 2x 2 is a linear combination of x1 and x2.
The simplest linear model is a constant beta 0.
The second simplest is a line, beta 0 plus beta 1x.
For Galton's data, we would denote and observe fathers' heights with x1
through xn.
Then we model end son heights we are trying
to predict with the following model.
Here, the little xi's are the father's heights, which are fixed not random,
due to the conditioning.
We've conditioned on these values.
And then Yi big Yi is the random son's height that we want to predict.
We further assume that the errors that are denoted
with the Greek letter for E, epsilon, epsilon i,
are independent from each other, have expected value 0,
and the standard deviation, which is usually called sigma,
does not depend on i.
It's the same for every individual.
We know the xi, but to have a useful model for prediction,
we need beta 0 and beta 1.
We estimate these from the data.
Once we do, we can predict the sons' heights from any father's height, x.
Note that if we further assume that the epsilons are normally distributed,
then this model is exactly the same one we derived earlier
for the bivariate normal distribution.
A somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach,
we assumed the data was a bivariate normal,
and the linear model was derived, not assumed.
In practice, linear models are just assumed
without necessarily assuming normality.
The distribution of the epsilons is not specified.
But nevertheless, **if your data is bivariate normal, the linear model that we just showed holds.**
**If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model.**
One reason linear models are popular is that **they are interpretable.**
In the case of Galton's data, we can interpret the data like this.
Due to inherited genes, the son's height prediction grows by beta
1 for each inch we increase the father's height x.
Because not all sons with fathers of height x are of equal height,
we need the term epsilon, which explains the remaining variability.
This remaining variability includes the mother's genetic effect,
environmental factors, and other biological randomness.
Note that given how we wrote the model, *the intercept beta 0 is not very interpretable, as it is the predicted height of a son with a father with no height.*
**Due to regression to the mean, the prediction will usually be a bit larger than 0, which is really not very interpretable.**
To make the intercept parameter more interpretable,
**we can rewrite the model slightly in the following way.**

![Linear model modified](figs/linear_model_rewritten_formula.png)

Here, we have changed xi to xi minus the average height x bar.
We have centered our covariate xi.
In this case, beta 0, the intercept, would
be the predicted height for the average father for the case
where xi equals x bar.

## Least Squares Estimates

### Least Squares Estimates (LSE)

For linear models to be useful,
we have to estimate the unknown parameters, the betas.
**The standard approach in science is to find the values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data.**
To quantify, this **we use the least squares equation.**
For Galton's data, we would write something like this.

![RSS formula](figs/rss_formula.png)


This quantity is called the Residual Sum of Squares, RSS.
Once we find the values that minimize the RSS,
we call the values the **Least Squares Estimate, LSE,**
and denote them, in this case, with beta 0 hat and beta 1 hat.
Let's write the function that computes the RSS for any pair of values,
beta 0 and beta 1, for our heights data.

![Betas hat](figs/betas_hat.png)

It would look like this.

```{r}
rss <- function(beta0, beta1, data){
   resid <- galton_heights$son - (beta0+beta1*galton_heights$father)
   return(sum(resid^2))
}
```



So for any pair of values, we get an RSS.
So **this is a three-dimensional plot with beta 1 and beta 2, and x and y and the RSS as a z.**
To find the minimum, you would have to look at this three-dimensional plot.
Here, we're just going to make a two-dimensional version
by keeping beta 0 fixed at 25.
So it will be a function of the RSS as a function of beta 1.
We can use this code to produce this plot.


```{r}
library(HistData)
data("GaltonFamilies")
galton_heights <- GaltonFamilies %>%
  filter(childNum == 1 && gender == "male") %>%
  select(father, childHeight) %>%
  rename( son= childHeight)


beta1 = seq( 0, 1, len=nrow(galton_heights))
results <- data.frame(beta1 = beta1,
              rss = sapply(beta1, rss, beta0=25))
results %>% ggplot(aes(beta1, rss)) + geom_line() +
geom_line(aes(beta1,rss), col=2)

```

```{r}
beta1 = seq( 0, 1, len=nrow(galton_heights))
results <- data.frame(beta1 = beta1,
              rss = sapply(beta1, rss, beta0=36))
results %>% ggplot(aes(beta1, rss)) + geom_line() +
geom_line(aes(beta1,rss), col=2)

```



*Expected by the exercise*
![Graph](figs/graph01.png)

**We can see a clear minimum for beta 1 at around 0.65.**
So you could see how we would pick the least squares estimates.
However, **this minimum is for beta 1 when beta 0 is fixed at 25. But we don't know if that's the minimum for beta 0.**
We don't know if 25 karma 0.65 minimizes the equation across all pairs.
**We could use trial and error, but it's really not going to work here.**
Instead we will use **calculus.**
We'll take the **partial derivatives, set them equal to 0, and solve for beta 1 and beta 0.**
Of course, if we have many parameters, these equations can get rather complex.
But there are functions in R that do these calculations for us.
We will learn these soon.
To learn the mathematics behind this, you
can consult the book on linear models.

### The lm Function

**In r, we can obtain the least squares estimates using the lm function.**
To fit the following model where Yi is the son's height
and Xi is the father height, 

![Linear model formula](figs/model_formula.png)

we would write the following piece of code.

```{r}
fit <- lm(son ~ father, data = galton_heights)
fit
```


This gives us the least squares estimates,
which we can see in the output of r.
The general way we use lm is by using the tilde character to let lm
know which is the value we're predicting that's on the left side of the tilde,
and which variables we're using to predict-- those
will be on the right side of the tilde.
The intercept is added automatically to the model.
So you don't have to include it when you write it.
The object fit that we just computed includes more information
about the least squares fit.
We can use the function summary to extract more of this information,
like this.

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

To understand some of the information included in this summary,
we need to remember that the LSE are random variables.
Mathematical statistics gives us some ideas
of the distribution of these random variables.
And we'll learn some of that next.  


Exercise:
*Run a linear model in R predicting the number of runs per game based on the number of bases on balls and the number of home runs. Remember to first limit your data to 1961-2001.*


```{r}
head(Teams) ## Reload the Teams dataset before procedding
dat1 <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(BB_per_game = BB/G, R_per_game = R/G, HR_per_game = HR/G)
head(dat1)

runs <- lm(R_per_game ~ BB_per_game+HR_per_game, data = dat1)
runs
## Result 0.3874 (from the exercise on the page it was rounded to: 0.39)
```


### LSE are Random Variables


The LSE are derived from the data, Y1 through Yn, which are random.
This implies that our estimates are random variables.
To see this, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation
in which we assume that the son and father height data that we
have defines an entire population.
And we're going to take random samples of size 50
and compute the regression slope coefficient for each one.
We write this code, which gives us several estimates of the regression
slope.

```{r}
B <- 1000
N <- 50
lse <- replicate(B, {
  sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %>%
    lm(son ~ father, data = .) %>% .$coef
})
lse <- data.frame(beta_0 = lse[1,], beta_1 = lse[2,])

```

We can see the variability of the estimates
by plotting their distribution.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- lse %>% ggplot(aes(beta_0)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = 'black')
p2 <- lse %>% ggplot(aes(beta_1)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = 'black')
grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=2)
```


Here you can see the histograms of the estimated beta 0's and the estimated
beta 1's.
**The reason these look normal is because the central limit theorem applies here as well.**
For large enough N, the least squares estimates
will be approximately normal with expected value beta 0 and beta 1
respectively.
The **standard errors are a bit complicated to compute, but mathematical theory does allow us to compute them**,
and they are included in the summary provided by the lm function.
Here are the estimated standard errors for one of our simulated data sets.

```{r}
sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %>%
  lm(son ~ father, data = .) %>% summary()
```


You could see them at the second column in the coefficients table.
You can see that the standard errors estimates reported by the summary
function are closed, so the standard errors
that we obtain from our Monte Carlo simulation.

```{r}
lse %>% summarize(se_0 = sd(beta_0), se_1 = sd(beta1))
```


The summary function also reports t-statistics--
this is the t value column--
and p-values.
This is the Pr bigger than absolute value of t column.
The t-statistic is not actually based on the central limit theorem,
but rather on the assumption that the epsilons follow a normal distribution.
Under this assumption, mathematical theory
tells us that the LSE divided by their standard error, which
we can see here and here, follow a t distribution with N
minus p degrees of freedom, with p the number of parameters in our model,
which in this case is 2.

![formula](figs/formula1.png)

The 2p values are testing the null hypothesis that beta 0 is 0
and beta 1 is 0 respectively.
Note that as we described previously, for large enough N,
the central limit works, and the t distribution becomes almost the same
as a normal distribution.
**So if either you assume the errors are normal and use the t distribution or if you assume that N is large enough to use the central limit theorem, you can construct confidence intervals for your parameters.**
We know here that although we will not show examples in this video,
hypothesis testing for regression models is very commonly used in, for example,
epidemiology and economics, to make statements such as the effect of A
and B was statistically significant after adjusting for X, Y, and Z.
**But it's very important to note that several assumptions-- we just described some of them-- have to hold for these statements to hold.**


### Advanced Note on LSE

Although interpretation is not straight-forward, it is also useful to know that the LSE can be strongly correlated, which can be seen using this code:

```{r}
lse %>% summarize(cor(beta_0, beta_1))
```

However, the correlation depends on how the predictors are defined or transformed.

Here we standardize the father heights, which changes xi to xi - x_hat


```{r}
B <- 1000
N <- 50
lse <- replicate(B, {
      sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %>%
      mutate(father = father - mean(father)) %>%
      lm(son ~ father, data = .) %>% .$coef 
})
```

Observe what happens to the correlation in this case:

```{r}
cor(lse[1,], lse[2,]) 
```

### Predicted Variable are Random Variables

Once we fit our model, we can obtain predictions of y
by plugging the estimates into the regression model.
For example, if the father's height is x, then our prediction for y--
which we'll denote with a [? hat ?] on top of the y--
for the son's height will be the following.

![Formula](figs/formula2.png)

We're just plugging in beta-- the estimated betas into the equation.
If we plot y hat versus x, we'll see the regression line.
Note that the prediction y hat is also a random variable,
and mathematical theory tells us what the standard errors are.
If we assume the errors are normal or have a large enough sample
size to use the Central Limit Theorem, we can construct confidence intervals
for our predictions, as well.
In fact, the ggplot layer geom underscore smooth,
when we set method equals to lm--
we've previously shown this for several plots--
plots confidence intervals around the predicted y hat.
Let's look at an example with this code.

```{r}
galton_heights %>% ggplot(aes(son, father)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


You can see the regression line.
Those are the predictions, and you see a band around them.
Those are the confidence intervals.
The R function predict takes an lm object as input
and returns these predictions.
We can see it here in this code which produces this plot,

```{r}
galton_heights %>%
  mutate(Y_hat = predict(lm(son ~ father, data = .))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(father, Y_hat)) +
  geom_line()
```

and if requested the standard errors and other information from which we
can construct confidence intervals can be obtained from the predict function.
You can see it by running this code.

```{r}
fit <- galton_heights %>% lm(son ~ father, data  = .)
Y_hat <- predict(fit, se.fit = TRUE)
names(Y_hat)
```

## Tibbles, do, and broom

### Advanced dplyr: Tibbles

Let's go back to baseball.
In a previous example, we estimated the regression lines
to predict runs from bases and balls in different home run strata.
We first constructed a data frame similar to this.

```{r}
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = round(HR/G, 1),
         BB = BB/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(HR,BB,R) %>%
  filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR <= 1.2)
```


Then, to compute the regression line in each strata,
since we didn't know the lm function back then,
we used the formula directly like this.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(slope = cor(BB,R)*sd(R)/sd(BB))
```


We argued that the slopes are similar and that the differences were perhaps
due to random variation.
To provide a more rigorous defense of the slopes being the same, which is what led to our multivariate regression model, we could compute confidence intervals for each slope.
We have not learned the formula for this, but the lm function provides enough information to construct them. **First, note that if we try to use the lm function to get the estimated slope like this, we don't get what we want.**

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  lm(R ~ BB, data = .) %>%
  .$coef
```


**The lm function ignored the group_by.**
*This is expected, because lm is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handle the outcome of group_by which is a group tibble.*
We're going to describe tibbles in some details now.
When summarize receives the output of group_by,
it somehow knows which rows of the table go with which groups.
But where is this information stored in the data frame?
Let's write some code to see the output of a group_by call.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>% head()
```


Note that there are no columns with the information needed
to define the groups.
But if you look closely at the output, you notice the line "A tibble, 6 by 3."
We can learn the class of the return object using this line of code,
and we see that the class is a "tbl."

```{r}
dat %>%  group_by(HR) %>% class()
```

This is pronounced "tibble."
It is also a tbl_df.
This is equivalent to tibble.
**The tibble is a special kind of data frame.**
We have seen them before, because tidyverse functions such as group_by
and also summarize always return this type of data frame.
**The group_by function returns a special kind of tibble, the grouped tibble.**
We will say more about the grouped tibbles later.
**Note that the manipulation verbs, select, filter, mutate, and arrange, don't necessarily return tibbles.**
They preserve the class of the input.
If they receive a regular data frame, they return a regular data frame.
If they receive a tibble, they return a tibble.
**But tibbles are the default data frame for the tidyverse.**
Tibbles are very similar to data frames.
*You can think of them as modern versions of data frames.*
Next, we're going to describe briefly three important differences.


### Tibbles: Differences from Data Frames

In this video, we're going to describe some of the main differences
between tibbles and data frames.
First, the print method for tibble is much more readable
than that of a data frame.
To see this, type teams on your console after loading the Baseball Lahman
Database.

```{r}
head(Teams)
```

**And you will see a very, very long list of columns and rows. It's barely readable.**
Teams is a data frame with many rows and columns.
That's why you see that.
Nevertheless, the output just shows everything wraps around
and is hard to read.
It is so bad that we don't even print it here.
We'll let you print it on your own screen.
Now if you convert this data frame to a tibble data frame,
the output is much more readable.
Here's an example.

```{r}
as_tibble(Teams)
```



**That's the first main difference between tibbles and data frames.**
A second one is that if you subset the columns of a data frame,
you may get back an object that is not a data frame.
Here's an example.
If we subset the 20th column, we get back an integer.
That's not a data frame.

```{r}
class(Teams[,20])
```


With tibbles, this is not the case.
Here's an example.

```{r}
class(as_tibble(Teams)[,20])
```


**If we subset a table, we get back a table.**
This is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.
Now whenever you want to access the original vector that
defines a column in a table, for this, you actually
have to use the accessor dollar sign.
Here's an example.


```{r}
class(as_tibble(Teams)$HR)
```

A related feature to this is that tibbles
**will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist.**
That's not the case for data frames.
For example, if we accidentally write hr in lowercase instead of uppercase,
with a data frame, all we get is a no.
No warning.

```{r}
Teams$hr
```

This can make it quite hard to debug code.
In contrast, if it's a tibble, and you try
to access the lowercase hr column, which doesn't exist,
you actually get a warning.


```{r}
as_tibble(Teams)$hr
```

**A third difference is that while columns of a data frame need to be a vector of number strings or Boolean, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions.**
Also note that we can create tibbles with the tibble function.
So, look at this line of code.
We're creating a column that actually has functions in it.
You can see the output here.


```{r}
tibble(id = c(1,2,3), func = c(mean, median, sd))
```


Finally, the **last difference we describe is that tibbles can be grouped.**
The function group by returns a special kind of tibble, a grouped tibble.
This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which
groups.
The tidyverse functions, in particular the summarize functions,
are aware of the group information.
**In the example we showed, we saw that the ln function, which is not part of the tidyverse, does not know how to deal with group tibbles. The object is basically converted to a regular data frame, and then the function runs ignoring the groups.**
This is why we only get one pair of estimates, as we see here.

```{r}
dat  %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  lm(R ~ BB, data = .)
```

To make these non-tidyverse function better integrate with a tidyverse,
we will learn a new function, the function do.

### do() function

In this video, we'll describe the very useful do( ) function.
The tidyverse functions know how to interpret group tibbles.
Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe,
tidyverse function consistently return data frames.
Since this assures that the output of 1 is accepted as the input of another.
But most our functions do not recognize group tibbles,
nor do they return data frames.
The lm( ) function is an example.
The do( ) function serves as a bridge between our functions,
such as lm( ) and the tidyverse.
**The do( ) function understands group tibbles and always returns a data frame.**
So let's try to use the do( ) function to fit a regression line to each home
run strata.
We would do it like this.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  do(fit = lm(R ~ BB, data = .))
```


Notice that we did in fact fit a regression line to each strata.
But the do( ) function would create a data frame with the first column being
the strata value.
And a column named fit.
We chose that name.
It could be any name.
**And that column will contain the result of the lm( ) call.**
**Therefore, the return table has a column with lm( ) objects in the cells,which is not very useful.**
Also note that **if we do not name a column, then do( ) will return the actual output of lm( ), not a data frame.**
And this will result in an error since do( ) is expecting a data frame
as output.
If you write this, you will get the following error.


`dat %>%`
`  group_by(HR) %>%`
`  do(lm(R ~ BB, data = .))`

*Error: Results 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... must be data frames, not lm*


For a useful data frame to be constructed,
the output of the function, inside do( ), must be a data frame as well.
**We could build a function that returns only what you want in the form of a data frame.**
We could write for example, this function.

```{r}
get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  data.frame(slope = fit$coefficients[2],
             se = summary(fit)$coefficient[2,2])
}
```


And then we use to do( ) without naming the output,
since we are already getting a data frame.
We can write this very simple piece of code
and now we get the expected result. We get the slope for each strata
and the standard error for that slope.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  do(get_slope(.))
```


If we name the output, then we get a column containing the data frame.
So if we write this piece of code, now once again,
we get one of these complex tibbles with a column
having a data frame in each cell.
Which is again, not very useful.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  do(slope = get_slope(.))
```


All right.
Now we're going to cover one last feature of do( ).
**If the data frame being returned has more than one row, these will be concatenated appropriately.**
Here's an example in which return both estimated parameters.

```{r}
get_lse <- function(data){
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  data.frame(term = names(fit$coefficients),
             slope = fit$coefficients,
             se = summary(fit)$coefficient[,2])
}

dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  do(get_lse(.))

```


The slope and intercept.
We write this piece of code.
And now we use the do( ) function as we used it before,
and get a very useful tibble, giving us the estimates of the slope
and intercept, as well as the standard errors.
Now, if you think this is all a bit too complicated, you're not alone.
To simplify things, we're going to introduce the broom package,
which was designed to facilitate the use of model fitting functions such as lm( ) with the tidyverse.


*Exercise*

You want to take the tibble dat, which we’ve been using in this video, and run the linear model R ~ BB for each strata of HR. Then you want to add three new columns to your grouped tibble: the coefficient, standard error, and p-value for the BB term in the model.

You’ve already written the function get_slope, shown below.
```{r}
get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  sum.fit <- summary(fit)

  data.frame(slope = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Estimate"], 
             se = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Std. Error"],
             pvalue = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Pr(>|t|)"])
}

dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(get_slope(.))

```


### broom() function

The original task we ask for in a previous video
was to provide an estimate and a confidence interval
for the slope estimates of each strata.
The broom packs will make this quite easy.
Broom has three main functions all of which
extract information from the object returned by the function lm,
and return it in a tidy verse friendly data frame.
These functions are:

    * tidy,
    * glance and
    * augment
  

The **tidy function** returns estimates and related information as a data frame.
Here's an example.

```{r}
library(broom)
fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = dat)
tidy(fit)
```


We can add other important summaries, such as confidence intervals,
using arguments like this.

```{r}
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
```


Because the outcome is a data frame, we can immediately
use it with do to string together the commands that
produce the table we are after.

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(HR) %>%
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE))
```


So this piece of code will generate what we wanted to see.
Because a data frame is returned, we can filter and select
the rows and columns we want.
So this simple piece of code gives us exactly the table we asked for.

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(HR) %>%
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(term == "BB") %>%
  select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```


We have filtered away the intercept rows, and only show the columns we
care about, the estimate and the confidence intervals.
Furthermore, a table like this makes visualization with GE plot quite easy.
So this piece of code produces this nice plot,
which provides very useful information.

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(HR) %>%
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ BB, data = .), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(term == "BB") %>%
  select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  ggplot(aes(HR, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_point()
```


Now we return to discussing our original task of determining if slopes change.
**The plot we just made using do and broom shows that the confidence intervals overlap, which provides a nice visual confirmation that our assumption that the slopes do not change with home run strata, is relatively safe.**
Earlier we mentioned two other functions from the broom package, **glance** and **augment** Glance and augment relate to model specific and observation specific outcomes, respectively.
Here we can see the model fit summary the glance returns.

```{r}
glance(fit)
```


You can learn more about these summaries in any regression textbook.
We'll see an example of augment in a future video.

## Regression and Baseball

### Building a Better Offensive Metric for Baseball

In trying to answer how well bases on balls predict runs,
data exploration let us to this model.

![Linear model formula](figs/linear_model_formula1.png)

Here, the data is approximately normal.
And conditional distributions were also normal.
Thus, we're justified to pose a linear model like this.

![Linear  model formula](figs/linear_model_formula2.png)

With yi, the runs per game.
x1, walks per game.
And x2, home runs per game.
To use lm here, we need to let it know that we have two predictive variables.
So we use the plus symbol as follows.
Here's a code that fits that multiple regression model.

```{r}
fit <- Teams %>%
  filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(BB = BB/G, HR = HR/G, R = R/G) %>%
  lm(R ~ BB + HR, data = .)
```

Now, we can use the tidy function to see the nice summary.

```{r}
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
```

*When we fit the model with only one variable without the adjustment, the estimated slopes were 0.735 and 1.844 for bases on ball and home runs, respectively.* (This is comparing to 0.387 and 1.56 in the current table)
But note that when we fit the multivariate model,
both these slopes go down with the bases on ball effect decreasing much more.

Now, if we want to construct a metric to pick players,
we need to consider single, doubles, and triples as well.
**Can we build a model that predicts runs based on all these outcomes?**
Now, we're going to take somewhat of a **leap of faith and assume that these five variables are jointly normal. This means that if we pick any one of them and hold the other for fixed, the relationship with the outcome-- in this case, runs per game-- is linear. And the slopes for this relationship do not depend on the other four values that were held constant. If this is true, if this model holds true, then a linear model for our data is the following.**

![Linear model formula](figs/linear_model_formula3.png)

With x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 representing bases on balls per game,
singles per game, doubles per game, triples per game, and home
runs per game, respectively.
Using lm, we can quickly find the least square errors for the parameters using
this relatively simple piece of code.

```{r}
fit <- Teams %>%
  filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(BB= BB/G,
         singles = (H-X2B-X3B-HR)/G,
         doubles = X2B/G,
         triples = X3B/G,
         HR = HR/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  lm(R ~ BB + singles + doubles + triples + HR, data = .)

coefs <- tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
coefs
```


We can again use the tidy function to see
the coefficients, the standard errors, and confidence intervals.
To see how well our metric actually predicts runs,
we can predict the number of runs for each team in 2002
using the function predict to make the plot.


```{r}
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 2002) %>%
  mutate(BB = BB/G,
         singles = (H-X2B-X3B-HR)/G,
         doubles = X2B/G,
         triples = X3B/G,
         HR = HR/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  mutate(R_hat = predict(fit,newdata = .)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(R_hat, R)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label=teamID), hjust = -0.2, vjust = 0.2) +
  geom_abline()
```


Note that we did not use the 2002 year to create this metric.
We used data from years previous to 2002.
And here is the plot.
Our model does quite a good job, as demonstrated by the fact
that points from the observed versus predicted plot fall
close to the identity line.
So instead of using batting average or just the number of home runs
as a measure for picking players, we can use our fitted model
to form a more informative metric that relates
more directly to run production.
Specifically, to define a metric for player A,
we imagine a team made up of players just like player A
and use our fitted a regression model to predict
how many runs this team would produce.
The formula would look like this.

![substituted formula](figs/substituted_formula.png)

We're basically sticking in the estimated coefficients
into the regression formula.
However, to define a player's specific metric, we have a bit more work to do.
**Our challenge here is that we have derived the metrics for teams based on team-level summary statistics.**
For example, the home run value that is entered into the equation
is home runs per game for the entire team.
If you compute the home runs per game for a player, it will be much lower.
As the total is accumulated by nine batters, not just one.
Furthermore, if a player only plays part of the game
and gets less opportunity than average, it's still considered a game play.
So this means that their rates will be lower than they should be.
**For players, a rate that takes into account opportunities is a per-plate-appearance rate.**
To make the per-game team rate comparable to the per-plate-appearance player rate, we compute the average number
of team plate appearances per game using this simple piece of code.

```{r}
pa_per_game <- Batting %>% filter(yearID == 2002) %>%
  group_by(teamID) %>%
  summarize(pa_per_game = sum(AB+BB)/max(G)) %>%
  .$pa_per_game %>%
  mean

pa_per_game
```


Now, we're ready to use our metric.
We're going to compute the per-plate-appearance rates for players
available in 2002.
But we're going to use data from 1999 2001.
Because remember, we are picking players in 2002.
We don't know what has happened yet.
To avoid small sample artifacts, we're going to filter players
with few plate interferences.
Here is the calculation of what we want to do in one long line of code
using tidyverse.

```{r}
players <- Batting %>% filter(yearID %in% 1999:2001) %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  mutate(PA = BB + AB) %>%
  summarize(G = sum(PA)/pa_per_game,
            BB = sum(BB)/G,
            singles = sum(H-X2B-X3B-HR)/G,
            doubles = sum(X2B)/G,
            triples = sum(X3B)/G,
            HR = sum(HR)/G,
            AVG = sum(H)/sum(AB),
            PA = sum(PA)) %>%
  filter(PA >= 300) %>%
  select(-G) %>%
  mutate(R_hat = predict(fit,newdata=.))
#Batting
players
```



So we fit our model.
And we have player-specific metrics.
The player-specific predicted runs computer here
can be interpreted as a number of runs we
would predict a team to score if this team
was made up of just that player, if that player batted every single time.
The distribution shows that there's y variability
across players, as we can see here.

```{r}
players %>% ggplot(aes(R_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color ="black")
```


To actually build the teams, we will need to know the players' salaries,
since we have a limited budget.
Remember, we are pretending to be the Oakland A's
in 2002 with only a $40 million budget.
We also need to know the players' position.
Because we're going to need one shortstop,
one second baseman, one third baseman, et cetera.
For this, we're going to have to do a little bit of data wrangling
to combine information that is contained in different tables
from the Lahman library.
OK, so here we go.
We start by adding the 2002 salaries for each player using this code.

```{r}
players <- Salaries %>% 
  filter(yearID == 2002) %>%
  select(playerID, salary) %>%
  right_join(players, by="playerID")
```


Next, we're going to add the defensive position.
This is a little bit complicated, because players
play more than one position each year.
So here, we're going to pick the one position most played by each player
using the top_n function.
And to make sure that we only pick one position in the case of ties,
we're going to take the first row if there is a tie.
We also remove the OF position.
Because this stands for outfielder, which
is a generalization of three positions-- left field, center field, right field.
We also remove pitchers, as they don't bat in the league
that the Athletics play.
Here is the code that does that.

```{r}
players <- Fielding %>%  filter(yearID == 2002) %>%
  filter(!POS %in% c("OF","P")) %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  top_n(1, G) %>%
  filter(row_number(G) == 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(playerID, POS) %>%
  right_join(players, by="playerID") %>%
  filter(!is.na(POS) & !is.na(salary))
players
```


Finally, we add their names and last names
so we know who we're talking about.
And here's a code that does that.

```{r}
players <- Master %>%
  select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, debut) %>%
  right_join(players, by="playerID")


players %>% select(nameFirst, nameLast, POS, salary, R_hat) %>%
  arrange(desc(R_hat)) %>%
  top_n(10)
```


So now, we have a table with our predicted run
statistic, some other statistic, the player's name, their position,
and their salary.
If we look at the top 10 players based on our run production statistic,
you're going to recognize some names if you're a baseball fan.
Note the very high salaries of these players in the top 10.
In fact, we see that players with high metrics have high salaries.
We can see that by making a plot we do see some low-cost players
with very high metrics.

```{r}
players %>% ggplot(aes(salary, R_hat, color=POS)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```


These would be great for our team.
Unfortunately, these are likely young players
that have not yet been able to negotiate a salary
and are not going to be available in 2002.
For example, the lowest earner on our top 10 list
is Albert Pujols, who was a rookie in 2001.
Here's a plot with players that debuted before 1997.

```{r}
players %>% filter(debut < 1998) %>%
  ggplot(aes(salary, R_hat, color= POS)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```


This removes all the young players.
We can now search for good deals by looking
at players that produce many more runs and others with similar salaries.
We can use this table to decide what players to pick and keep
our total salary below the $40 million Billy Beane had to work with.

### Building a Better Offensive Metric for Baseball: Linear Programming

A way to actually pick the players for the team can be done using what computer scientists call linear programming. Although we don't go into this topic in detail in this course, we include the code anyway:

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(lpSolve)

players <- players %>% filter(debut <= 1997 & debut > 1988)
constraint_matrix <- acast(players, POS ~ playerID, fun.aggregate = length)
npos <- nrow(constraint_matrix)
constraint_matrix <- rbind(constraint_matrix, salary = players$salary)
constraint_dir <- c(rep("==", npos), "<=")
constraint_limit <- c(rep(1, npos), 50*10^6)
lp_solution <- lp("max", players$R_hat,
                  constraint_matrix, constraint_dir, constraint_limit,
                  all.int = TRUE) 
```

This algorithm chooses these 9 players:

```{r}
our_team <- players %>%
  filter(lp_solution$solution == 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(R_hat))
our_team %>% select(nameFirst, nameLast, POS, salary, R_hat)
```

We note that these players all have above average BB and HR rates while the same is not true for singles.

```{r}

my_scale <- function(x) (x - median(x))/mad(x)
players %>% mutate(BB = my_scale(BB), 
                   singles = my_scale(singles),
                   doubles = my_scale(doubles),
                   triples = my_scale(triples),
                   HR = my_scale(HR),
                   AVG = my_scale(AVG),
                   R_hat = my_scale(R_hat)) %>%
    filter(playerID %in% our_team$playerID) %>%
    select(nameFirst, nameLast, BB, singles, doubles, triples, HR, AVG, R_hat) %>%
    arrange(desc(R_hat))
```

### On Base Plus Slugging (OPS)

Since the 1980s sabermetricians have used
a summary statistic different from batting average to evaluate players.
They realized walks were important, and that doubles, triples,
and home runs should be weighted much more than singles,
and proposed the following metric.

![Formula](figs/formula3.png)

They call this **on-base-percentage plus slugging percentage, or OPS.**
Today, this statistic has caught on, and you see it
in ESPN and other sports networks.
Although the sabermetricians are probably not using regression,
this metric is impressively close to what
one gets with regression to the summary statistic that we created.
Here is the plot.
They're very correlated.

![Plot](figs/plot1.png)


### Regression Fallacy


Wikipedia defines the sophomore slump in the following way.
**A sophomore slump or sophomore jinx or sophomore jitters refers to an instance in which a second, or sophomore, effort fails to live up to the standard of the first effort.**
It is commonly used to refer to the apathy of students--
second year of high school, college, university--
the performance of athletes-- second season of play--
singers/bands-- second album-- television shows-- second season--
and movies-- sequels or prequels.
We hear about the sophomore slump often in Major League Baseball.
This is because in Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year--
this is an award that's given to the first year player that
is judged to have performed the best--
usually does not perform as well during their second year.
Therefore they call this the sophomore slump.
Know, for example, that in a recent Fox Sports article
they asked, will MLB's tremendous rookie class of 2015 suffer a sophomore slump.
Now does the data confirm the existence of a sophomore slump?
Let's take a look and examine the data for batting averages
to see if the observation holds true.
The data is available in the Lehman Library, but we have
to do some work to create a table with the statistics for all the rookies
of the year.
Let's go through them.
First, we create a table with player ID, their names and their most
played position, using this code.


```{r}
library(Lahman)
playerInfo <- Fielding %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  arrange(desc(G)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  left_join(Master, by="playerID") %>%
  select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, POS)
head(playerInfo)

```

Now we will create a table with only the Rookie of the Year Award winners
and add their batting statistics.
We're going to filter out pitchers since pitchers are not
given awards for batting.
And we're going to focus on offense.
Specifically, we'll focus on batting average
since it is the summary that most pundits talk about when
discussing the sophomore slump.
So we write this piece of code to do this.

```{r}
ROY <- AwardsPlayers %>%
  filter(awardID == "Rookie of the Year") %>%
  left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
  rename(rookie_year = yearID) %>%
  right_join(Batting, by="playerID") %>%
  mutate(AVG = H/AB) %>%
  filter(POS != "P")
head(ROY)
```


Now we'll keep only the rookie and sophomore seasons
and remove players that did not play a sophomore season.

```{r}
ROY <- ROY %>%
  filter(yearID == rookie_year | yearID == rookie_year + 1) %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  mutate(rookie = ifelse(yearID == min(yearID), "rookie", "sophomore")) %>%
  filter(n() == 2) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(playerID, rookie_year, rookie, nameFirst, nameLast, AVG)

head(ROY)
```


And remember, now we're only looking at players
that won the Rookie of the Year Award.
This code achieves what we want.
Finally, we will use the spread function to have one column for the rookie
and another column for the sophomore years' batting averages.
For that we use this simple line of code.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ROY <- ROY %>%
  spread(rookie, AVG) %>% 
  arrange(desc(rookie))
head(ROY)
```


Now we can see the top performers in their first year.
These are the Rookie of the Year Award winners.
And we're showing their rookie season batting average
and their sophomore season batting average.
Look closely and you will see the sophomore slump.
It definitely appears to be real.
In fact, the proportion of players that have a lower batting average
their sophomore years is 68%.

So is it jitters?
Is it a jinx?
To answer this question, let's turn our attention to all players.
We're going to look at the 2013 season and 2014 season.
And we're going to look at players that batted at least 130 times.
This is a minimum needed to win the Rookie of the Year.
We're going to perform a similar operation as we
did before to construct this data set.
Here is the code.

```{r}
two_years <- Batting %>%
  filter(yearID %in% 2013:2014) %>%
  group_by(playerID, yearID)  %>%
  filter(sum(AB) >= 130) %>%
  summarize(AVG = sum(H)/sum(AB)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  spread(yearID, AVG) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2013`) & !is.na(`2014`)) %>%
  left_join(playerInfo, by = "playerID") %>%
  filter(POS !="P") %>%
  select(-POS) %>%
  arrange(desc(`2013`)) %>%
  select(-playerID)
head(two_years)
  
```


Now let's look at the top performers of 2013
and then look at their performance in 2014.
Note that the same pattern arises when we look at the top performers.
Batting averages go down for the top performers.
But these are not rookies.
So this can't be explained with a sophomore slump.
Also know what happens to the worst performers of 2013.
Here they are.

```{r}
arrange(two_years, `2013`)
```


Their batting averages go up in their second season in 2014.
Is this some sort of reverse sophomore slump?
It is not.
There is no such thing as a sophomore slump.
**This is all explained with a simple statistical fact.**
**The correlation of performance in two separate years is high but not perfect.**
Here is the data for 2013 performance and 2014 performance.

```{r}
two_years %>% ggplot(aes(`2013`,`2014`)) + geom_point()
```

You can see it's correlated.
But it's not perfectly correlated.
The correlation is 0.46.

```{r}
summarize(two_years, cor(`2013`,`2014`))
```

The data look very much like a bivariate normal distribution, which
means that if we were to predict the 2014 batting average, let's call it y,
for any given player that had a 2013 batting average of x,
we would use the regression equation, which would be this.

![Formula](figs/formula4.png)

Because a correlation is not perfect, regression
tells us that on average, we expect high performers from 2013
to do a little bit worse in 2014.
**This regression to the mean.**
It's not a jinx.
It's just due to chance.
The rookies of the year are selected from the top values of x
So it is expected that their y will regress to the mean.


### Measurement Error Models

Up until now, all our linear regression examples
have been applied to two or more random variables.
We assume the pairs are bivariate normal and use this
to motivate a linear model.
This approach covers most of real life examples
where linear regression is used.
**The other major application comes from measurement error models.**
In these applications, it is common to have
a nonrandom covariates, such as time.
And randomness is introduced from measurement error, rather than
sampling or natural variability.
To understand these models, we're going to use a motivation
example related to physics.
Imagine you are Galileo in the 16th century trying to describe
the velocity of a falling object.
An assistant climbs the Tower of Pisa and drops a ball.
While several other assistants record the position at different times.
The falling object data set contains an example
of what that data would look like.
The assistant hands the data to Galileo and this is what he sees.


´falling_object %>% ´  
´  ggplot(aes(time, observed_distance)) +´  
´  geom_point() +´  
´  ylab("Distance in meters") +´  
´  xlab("Time in seconds")´  


He uses ggplot to make a plot.
![Graph](figs/graph02.png)

Here we see the distance in meters that has dropped
on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.
Galileo does not know the exact equation,
but from data exploration, by looking at the plot,
he deduces that the position should follow a parabola, which
we can write like this.

![Formula parabola](figs/parabola_formula.png)

The data does not fall exactly on a parabola,
**but Galileo knows that this is due to measurement error.**
His helpers make mistakes when measuring the distance the ball has fallen.
To account for this, we write this model.

![Formula parabola](figs/parabola_formula_with_error.png)

Here, y represents the distance the ball is dropped in meters.
Xi represents time in seconds.
And epsilon represents measurement error.
The measurement error is assumed to be random, independent from each other
and having the same distribution from each i.
We also assume that there is no bias, which
means that the expected value of epsilon is 0.
**Note that this is a linear model because it is a linear combination of known quantities.**
X and x squared are known and unknown parameters, the betas.
Unlike our previous example, the x's are fixed quantities.
This is just time.
We're not conditioning.
Now to pose a new physical theory and start
making predictions about other falling objects,
Galileo needs actual numbers, rather than the unknown parameters.
The LSE squares estimates seem like a reasonable approach.
So how do we find the LSE squares estimates?
**Note that the LSE calculations do not require the errors to be approximately normal.**
**The lm( ) function will find the betas that minimize the residual sum of squares, which is what we want.**
So we use this code to obtain our estimated parameters.


´fit <- falling_object %>% ´  
´  mutate(time_sq = time^2) %>%´  
´  lm(y~time+time_sq, data=.)´  

![Galileo Results](figs/galileo_results.png)

To check if the estimated parabola fits the data,
the broom function augment( ) lets us do this easily.
Using this code, 

´augment(fit) %>%´ 
´   ggplot() +´
´   geom_point(aes(time, y)) +´
´   geom_line(aes(time, fitted))´


we can make the following plot.

![Graph 3](figs/graph03.png)

Note that the predicted values go right through the points.
Now, thanks to my high school physics teacher,
I know that the equation for the trajectory of a falling object
is the following.

![Falling object formula](figs/falling_object_formula.png)

With h0 and v0, the starting height and starting velocity respectively.
The data we use follow this equation and added measurement error
to simulate and observations.
Dropping the ball, that means the starting velocity is 0
because we start just by dropping it from the Tower of Pisa, which
has a height of about 56.67 meters.
These known quantities are consistent with the parameters
that we estimated, which we can see using the tidy function.
Here they are.

![Tidy Pissa Tower](figs/tidy_pissa.png)

The Tower of Pisa height is within the confidence interval for beta 0.
The initial velocity of 0 is in the confidence interval for beta 1.
Note that the p value is larger than 0.05,
which means we wouldn't reject the hypothesis that the starting velocity
is 0.
And finally, the acceleration constant is in the confidence intervals
for negative 2 times beta 2.
