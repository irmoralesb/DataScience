# Additional types of data analysis

There are some additional types of data analysis, such as:

* Trivariate Analysis
    - Qualitative Trivariate Analysis
    - 2 Qual. 1 Quant. Analysis
    - 1 Qual. 1 Quant. Analysis
    - Quantitative Trivariate Analysis
* n-variable Multivariate Analysis
* Spatial Analysis
* Hierarchichal Analysis
* Graph Analysis
* Textual Analysis
    
    
# Best Practices

1. Star with a question
2. Use the right tool for the job
   * Take into account the audience.
3. Know your audience
   * Exploratory data visualization
   * Expository or explanatory data visualization
4. Remove the junk, that is the unneeded components in the chart.
    * Keep it clean and simple.
5. Avoid Information distortions
    * for instance show the entire Y-axis value range.
    
# Demo

## Cleaning up data visualizations

Create a frequency bar chart with defaults

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("data/Movies.csv")
plot(movies$Rating)
```

Add context to our bar chart

```{r}
plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Create a color palette

```{r}
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(RColorBrewer)
palette <- brewer.pal(9,"Pastel1")
```

Clean up our bar chart

```{r}
plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  col = palette[2],
  border = NA,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Save as PNG image
Note, other formats are PDF and SVG.

```{r}
png(
  filename = "Count of Movies by Rating.png",
  width = 640,
  height = 480)

plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  col = palette[2],
  border = NA,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Then we need to close the graphics device

```{r}
#dev.off()
```

Save the ggplot data visualization

```{r}
?ggsave
```

```{r}
