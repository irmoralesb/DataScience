# Chart Types

## Qualitative Univariate Analysis

This focus on categories or non-numeric variables, and in this case we are interested on only one variable, and we are interested on, for instance:  

## Univariate Visualization for a Qualitative Variable

### What does it measure?

* Frequency
* Average
    
### It can answer questions like

    1. How many movies in each rating category?  
    2. What proporcion of movies have won awards?

## Univariate Visualization for a Quantitative Variable

### What does it measure?

* Location of the data
* Spread of the data
* Shape of the data

## Qualitative Bivariate Analysis

### What does it measure?

  * Interested on the joint frequency of observations
  * Useful for the intersection of two categories
  * We can use a contingency table, for instance, the intersection between cols and rows
  * Use of marginal frequencies
  * Use relative frequency
    
    
**Marginal Frequency**: That is the total columns or rows, it may be count, sum, etc.  

**Relative frequency**: That is the percentage ( values between 0 and 1)  

**Contingency table**: AKA: 

  * Two-dimensional frequency table
  * Two-way table
  * Cross tabulation matrix
