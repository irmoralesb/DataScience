# Chart Types

## Qualitative Univariate Analysis

This focus on categories or non-numeric variables, and in this case we are interested on only one variable, and we are interested on, for instance:  

## Univariate Visualization for a Qualitative Variable

### What does it measure?

* Frequency
* Average
    
### It Can Answer Questions Like

    1. How many movies in each rating category?  
    2. What proporcion of movies have won awards?

## Univariate Visualization for a Quantitative Variable

### What does it measure?

* Location of the data
* Spread of the data
* Shape of the data

### It Can Answer Questions Like

  1. What is the average movie runtime?
  2. Are there any outliers?
  3. How spread out are the movie runtimes?
  4. What is the shape of the runtime distribution?

## Qualitative Bivariate Analysis

### What does it measure?

  * Interested on the joint frequency of observations
  * Useful for the intersection of two categories
  * We can use a contingency table, for instance, the intersection between cols and rows
  * Use of marginal frequencies
  * Use relative frequency

    
**Marginal Frequency**: That is the total columns or rows, it may be count, sum, etc.  

**Relative frequency**: That is the percentage ( values between 0 and 1)  

**Contingency table**: AKA: 

  * Two-dimensional frequency table
  * Two-way table
  * Cross tabulation matrix

### It Can Answer Questions Like

  1. How many award-winning movies are in each rating category?
  2. What proportion of movies in each category have won awards?

  * [Spine Plot](spined_plot.md)
  * [Mosaic Plot](mosaic_plot.md)

## Quantitive Bivariate Analysis

*In this topic we are covering the relationship between two numeric variables.*
  
### What Does It Measure?

  * Interested in how two numeric variables are related
  * Location, Spread and Shape of the distribution at the same time
  * Time series analysis


### It Can Answer Questions Like

  1. How are runtime and box-office revenue related?
  2. Has the average box-office revenue changed over time?
