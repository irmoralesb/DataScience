# Degrees Of Freedom

As you have seen, when we calculate the mean, variance for a population we use N, which is the total number the elements, but when we are working with samples, we use n-1. The Degrees of Freedom concept has to do with this point, I will cover in depth this topic later but so far we can be aware that:

If we use in a sample
* n-1 : It is considered that is unbiased estimate
* n : It is considered biased estimate
