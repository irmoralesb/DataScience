# Expected Value

When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a category's probability of occurence.

A special type of categorical data is data in which the categories represent or canmapped to discrete values on the same scale.

## Formula

1. Multiply each outcome by its probability of occurrence.
2. Sum these values.
