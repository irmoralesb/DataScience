# Moments of Distribution

In statistics there are four:

    1) Location
    2) Distribution
    3) Skewness
    4) kurtosis


## Estimates of Location

> This refers to find a "typical value" for each feature of the data set, a estimate of where most of the data is located.

* [Mean](mean.md)
* [Median](median.md)
    * [Outliers](outliers.md)
## Estimates of Variability/Dispersion

> a.k.a Dispersion, measures whether the data values are tightly clustered or spread out. 

* Based on Deviation
  * [Variance](deviation.md)
  * [Standard Deviation](deviation.md)
    * [Degrees of Freedom](degrees_of_freedom.md)
  * [Median Absolute Deviation](mad.md)
* Based on Percentiles
  
  Statistics based on sorted/ranked data are referred as **Order Statistics**.
  * [Range](range.md)
  * [Percentiles And Quantiles](percentiles.md)


## Skewness

> It refers to whether the data is skewed to a larger or smaller values

This usually is discovered when looking the graphs.

## Kurtosis

> It indicates the propensity of the data to have extreme values

This usually is discovered when looking the graphs.
