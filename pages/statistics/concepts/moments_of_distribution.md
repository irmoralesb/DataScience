# Moments of Distribution

In statistics there are four:

    1) Location
    2) Distribution
    3) Skewness
    4) kurtosis


## Estimates of Location

> This refers to find a "typical value" for each feature of the data set, a estimate of where most of the data is located.

## Estimates of Distribution

> a.k.a Dispersion, measures whether the data values are tightly clustered or spread out. 

## Skewness

> It refers to whether the data is skewed to a larger or smaller values

This usually is discovered when looking the graphs.

## Kurtosis

> It indicates the propensity of the data to have extreme values

This usually is discovered when looking the graphs.
