# Confidence Interval

Frequency tables, histograms, boxplots, and standard errors are all ways to understand the potential error in a sample estimate. Confidence intervals are another.

* **Confidence Level**. The percentage of confidence intervals, constructed in the same way from the same population, that are expected to contain the statistic of interest.

* **Interval Endpoints**. The top and bottom of the interval confidence.
