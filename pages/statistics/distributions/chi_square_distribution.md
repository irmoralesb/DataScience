# Chi-Square Distribution

The statistic that measures the extent to which results depart from the **null expectation of independence** is the chi-square statistic.

* The chi-square distribution is typically concerned with **counts** of subjects or items falling into categories.
* The chi-square statistic measures the extent of departure from what you would expect in a null model.

The chi-square distribution is the distribution of this statistic under repeated resampled draws from the null model.

* **A low chi-square** value for a set of counts indicates that they closely follow the expected distribution.
* **A high chi-square** indicates that they differ markedly from what is expected.

> There are a variety of chi-square distributions associated with different degrees of freedom.

## Process

It is the difference between the observed and expected values, divided by the square root of the expected value, squared, then summed across all categories.

This process standardizes the statistic so it can be compared to a reference distribution. A more general way of putting this is to note that the chi-square statistic is a measure of the extent to which a set of observed values “fits” a specified distribution (a “goodness-of-fit” test).
