# F Distribution

> It's dealing with measured contious values rather than counts (Chi-Squared).

In this case we are interested in the extent to which differences among group means are greater than we might expect under normal random variation. The F-statistic measures this and is the ratio of the variability among the group means to the variability within each group (also called residual variability). This comparison is termed an  analysis of variance.

The distribution of the Fstatistic is the frequency distribution of all the values that would be produced by randomly permuting data in which all the group means are equal (i.e., a null model). There are a variety of F-distributions associated with different degrees of freedom.

The F-statistic is also used in linear regression to compare the variation accounted for by the regression model to the overall variation in the data. F-statistics are produced automatically by  R  and  Python  as part of regression and ANOVA routines.
