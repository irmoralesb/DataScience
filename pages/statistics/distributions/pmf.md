# Probability mass function (PMF)

* The set of probabilities of discrete outcomes

## Discrete uniform PMF

* It's discrete, because only certain values can be obtain
* It's uniform, because all values have the same probability to happen

Example

The outcome of rolling a single fair dice is:

* Discrete: 1,2,3,4,5 or 6
* Uniform: each element has 1/6 of probability of success
