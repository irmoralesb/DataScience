# Probability Proportion

## Probability Distribution for Categorical outcomes

> Assign probability to each category

This assignment is based of the number of elements each category has.

So having the following proportion:
40% red beads
60% blue beads

Gives you the probability.

## Independence

> Two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other

### Examples

* For instance coin tosses, each time the coin is toss the probability is the same: <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="../../svg/oLxoSpOqAR.svg">

* Another instance is the case where the beads are picked from the urn, **with replacement**. The probability of red beads is: <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="../../svg/oiIxoWX3LZ.svg">

* One example of no independence is when you are doing the same event of the beads but without replacement, since the next event has a different probability for the different number of beads (and its proportion).

## Probability Conditional

We use it when we need to evaluate probabilities under specific conditions

* For instance, what is the probability of a second card is a king, given the first card was a king.

## Formulas

### Independece

The conditional probability can also include more than one condition

### Not Independence

> Example by using 21 card game

    What is the probability of getting an As, and then a card with value of 10

    1/13 * 16/51 = 0.02

The conditional probability can also include more than one condition
