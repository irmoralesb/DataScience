# Discrete Probability

> It's related to categorical data.

Having an example of 5 balls, 2 red and 3 blue, what is the probability to pick a red ball? 2/5 or 40%

but more formally, five possible outcomes, of which two satisfy the contdition necesary for the event "pick a red ball"

A more generic way to define it:

## Probability of a event

Proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment over and over, independently and under the same conditions.

## Probability of a event to happen

## Event

Things that can happen when something happens by chance

## Probabilty of a subset

If we have a dice, what is the probability of getting 4

If we want to know the probability of getting a number less or equal than 4, then we need to add all the probabilities, CDF.
