## My Data Science Notes

I am a software developer for a while, my main path is Full Stack Web Developer using Microsoft Technologies, but I have done some iOS Development and in the last couple of years I have started learning about Machine Learning...

I started taking Machine Learning courses online, also reading some books, but as soon as I started getting familar with this technology I realized I needed to learn R and/or Python, which those programming langues were new to me, also revisit and learn new stuff related to Statistics, IDE, and some additional stuff... it has been a long path.

I still work as Web Developer, but I think I'm in a point that I need to review all I have learned just to keep it fresh in my mind, and start practicing
