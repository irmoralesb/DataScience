Visualizing Two Categorical Variable
================

Qualitative Bivariate Analysis
==============================

*In this topic we are covering the relationship between two categorical variables.*

    * Interested on the joint frequency of observations
    * Useful for the intersection of two categories
    * We can use a contingency table, for instance, the intersection between cols and rows
    * Use of marginal frequencies
    * Use relative frequency

**Marginal Frequency**: That is the total columns or rows, it may be count, sum, etc.

**Relative frequency**: That is the percentage ( values between 0 and 1)

**Contingency table**: AKA:

    * Two-dimensional frequency table
    * Two-way table
    * Cross tabulation matrix

### Grouped Frequency Bar Chart

*Aka: Cluster or dodged frequency bar chart)*

It allows us to compare two variables, for instance we can see on X-axis the ratings, on Y-axis count of movies, but spliting the count on movies with awards. so you can compare one bar against the other easily.

### Stacked Frequency Bar Chart

It is similar than the previous, but the bar are in stack, so you can answer questions of type:

    * Marginal frequency
    * Joint frequency
    * Part of whole

*Chose this data visualization when comparing the marginal frequency opf one category is more important than comparing the joint frequency across categories.*

### 100% Stacked Frequency Bar Chart

it is pretty much the same than Grouped frequency bar chart, but we strech the bar to fill the whole area, answer questions of type:

    * Relative frequency
    * One variable

### Spine Plot

The bar width of each category on X-axis changes according to the proportion of observations, the height the count, and the color correspond to the category.

    * Relative frequency
    * Both variables

### Mosaic Plot

Similar to Spine plot, the key difference is it may display intersection of categories, otherwise empty space between each category bars
