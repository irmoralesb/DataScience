# Qualitative Bivariate Analysis

*In this topic we are covering the relationship between two categorical variables.*  


    * Interested on the joint frequency of observations
    * Useful for the intersection of two categories
    * We can use a contingency table, for instance, the intersection between cols and rows
    * Use of marginal frequencies
    * Use relative frequency
    
    
**Marginal Frequency**: That is the total columns or rows, it may be count, sum, etc.  

**Relative frequency**: That is the percentage ( values between 0 and 1)  

**Contingency table**: AKA: 

    * Two-dimensional frequency table
    * Two-way table
    * Cross tabulation matrix
    
    
## Plots

### Grouped Frequency Bar Chart

*Aka: Cluster or dodged frequency bar chart)*  

It allows us to compare two variables, for instance we can see on X-axis the ratings, on Y-axis count of movies, but spliting the count on movies with awards. so you can compare one bar against the other easly.

### Stacked Frequency Bar Chart

It is similar than the previous, but the bar are in stack, so you can answer questions of type:

    * Marginal frequency
    * Joint frequency
    * Part of whole

*Chose this data visualization when comparing the marginal frequency opf one category is more important than comparing the joint frequency across categories.*


### 100% Stacked Frequency Bar Chart

it is pretty much the same than Grouped frequency bar chart, but we strech the bar to fill the whole area, answer questions of type:


    * Relative frequency
    * One variable

### Spine Plot

The bar width of each category on X-axis changes according to the proportion of observations, the height the count, and the color correspond to the category.


    * Relative frequency
    * Both variables


### Mosaic Plot
Similar to Spine plot, the key difference is  it may display intersection of categories, otherwise empty space between each category bars
