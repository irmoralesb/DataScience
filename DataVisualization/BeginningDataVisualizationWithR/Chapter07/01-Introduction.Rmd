# Additional types of data analysis

There are some additional types of data analysis, such as:

    * Trivariate Analysis
      - Qualitative Trivariate Analysis
      - 2 Qual. 1 Quant. Analysis
      - 1 Qual. 1 Quant. Analysis
      - Quantitative Trivariate Analysis
    * n-variable Multivariate Analysis
    * Spatial Analysis
    * Hierarchichal Analysis
    * Graph Analysis
    * Textual Analysis
    
    
# Best Practices


    1. Star with a question
    2. Use the right tool for the job
      a. Take into account the audience.
    3. Know your audience
      a. Exploratory data visualization
      b. Expository or explanatory data visualization
    4. Remove the junk, that is the unneeded components in the chart.
      a. Keep it clean and simple.
    5. Avoid Information distortions
      a. for instance show the entire Y-axis value range.
    
# Demo

##Cleaning up data visualizations

Create a frequency bar chart with defaults

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("../data/Movies.csv")
plot(movies$Rating)
```

Add context to our bar chart

```{r}
plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Create a color palette

```{r}
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(RColorBrewer)
palette <- brewer.pal(9,"Pastel1")
```

Clean up our bar chart

```{r}
plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  col = palette[2],
  border = NA,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Save as PNG image
Note, other formats are PDF and SVG.

```{r}
png(
  filename = "Count of Movies by Rating.png",
  width = 640,
  height = 480)

plot(
  x = movies$Rating,
  col = palette[2],
  border = NA,
  main = "Count of Movies by MPAA Rating Category",
  xlab = "MPAA Rating Category",
  ylab = "Count of Movies")
```

Then we need to close the graphics device

```{r}
#dev.off()
```

Save the ggplot data visualization

```{r}
?ggsave
```


View help for plots and parameters
```{r}
?barplot

?par
