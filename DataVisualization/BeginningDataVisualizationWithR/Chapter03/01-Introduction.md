Quantitative Univariate Analysis
================

Analysis of a single numeric variable.

Answer questions related to:

    * Location of the data
    * Spread of the data
    * Shape of the data

Data Visualizations
-------------------

### Dot Plot

    * Location - Shows location and distribution
    * Simple - Show few data, for instance: min/max and where are located the most of the observations
    * Small size

### Jitter Plot

    * Contains the same data of the dot plot
    * Uses empty circles and jitter
        + Jitter is noise that is used to avoid points overlapping, so they are spread alog y-axis just to show the samples
    * Large sample size
    * Discrete values

### Box Plot

    * Same data than previous two
    * No dimension on y-axis
      + Min Value
      + Max  Value
      + First quartile
      + Median
      + Third quartile
      + Outliers
    * Location of data
    * Spread
    * Range

### Histogram

    * Shows distribution of values by grouping them in bins
    * Location
    * Shape of data

### Density Plot

    * Shape
    * Location
    * Spread
    * Smooth
